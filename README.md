# CS551N-Assessment---DB-Flask-App
Database Driven App with Flask with open source Country, Population and GDP Data Amongst others


Database driven flask web-app with open source  Countries data.
Created Classes and methods and used OOP programming essentials to create the app.
Used templates from Flask

Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine, which allows us to create templates for our pages with dynamic content. We will create templates for our homepage, search results page, and individual item page. These templates will be based on Bootstrap 4 framework, which will help us to create a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.

# Error handling
Error Handling is an essential part of any application. We will use Flask's built-in error handling functions to handle different types of errors that may occur during the use of the application. We will also display appropriate error messages to the user in case of any errors.
To ensure that our codebase is maintainable, readable, and scalable, we will follow best practices in software development. We will use Flask's built-in functionality and extensions to make our application more modular and easy to maintain. We will also use object-oriented programming principles to structure our codebase in a logical and organized way.

# Testing 
Testing is an essential part of software development. We will use the pytest framework to create tests for our codebase. We will write unit tests to test individual functions and integration tests to test the overall functionality of the application. This will help us to catch errors and bugs before they reach the end-users of the application.
Render is a cloud hosting platform that allows developers to deploy and manage their applications easily.

# Deploying
We will use Render to host our Flask application. This will allow us to deploy our application quickly, scale it easily, and monitor it for any issues.
Documentation is essential for any software project. We will document our application's design, development, implementation, installation, and use in a one-page final report. We will also include detailed instructions on how to install and use the application in the readme.md file of the repository.
